# Code Component Documentation

## Purpose
The Code component is designed to render `<code>` elements for displaying code blocks or snippets. It provides consistent styling and accessibility features for inline code elements.

## Props
- `children`: Content to render inside the `<code>` element. Type: `ReactNode`
- All other props are spread to the underlying `<code>` element

## Usage
```tsx
import { Code } from '@iguzman/ui/Code';

function Example() {
  return (
    <p>
      The function <Code>calculateTotal()</Code> returns the sum.
    </p>
  );
}
```

## Implementation Details
The component is implemented as an arrow function that accepts props and spreads the rest of the props to the underlying `<code>` element. It handles cases where children might be undefined or null by returning an empty `<code>` element in those cases.
