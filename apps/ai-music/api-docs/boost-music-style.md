# Boost Music Style

This is an exclusive capability of V4\_5. The style functionality of V4\_5 has been significantly enhanced, as stated on the official website:

> One of the many advantages of the new 4.5 model is its ability to accommodate more detailed style instructions. In previous models, it was necessary to prioritize specific genre and style details, but now instructions can incorporate a more conversational prompt.
>
> Previously, optimal results might have been achieved with a prompt like: 'deep house, emotional, melodic.'
>
> Now, you can provide a prompt such as: 'Create a melodic, emotional deep house song featuring organic textures and hypnotic rhythms. Begin with soft ambient layers, natural sounds, and a deep, steady groove. Gradually build with flowing melodic synths, warm basslines, and intricate, subtle percussion.'

The 'Boost Your Style' feature will significantly enhance users' ability to describe and control style. It is recommended for use.

### Parameter Description

* content: Required, string type. Style description is required.
