# website - App-Specific Conventions

## Auth - shared via `@repo/auth`

The auth stack lives in **`@repo/auth`** and is shared with `cinelog` and
`edge-folio`. Read `packages/auth/CLAUDE.md` first - it documents the session model
and the invariants. Only the website-specific parts are listed here.

JWTs live in HTTP-only `access_token` / `refresh_token` cookies and are **invisible
to JavaScript**. There is no `getAccessToken()`, no `Authorization` header built in
the browser, and no user in `localStorage`.

- **Identity is server-derived.** `getSession()` decodes the access cookie during the
  request; the root layout passes it to `<SessionProvider>`; client components read
  `useSession()`. `isAdmin` and `systemId` are **claims on the token**, so the admin
  nav renders correctly in the first HTML. They only drive presentation - Django
  re-derives both from the token on every call, and `proxy.ts` guards `/admin` and
  `/account`.
- **Browser → Django always goes through a Route Handler.** Client code calls
  same-origin `/api/auth/*` (see `lib/auth.ts`); the handler attaches the bearer
  token from the cookie. Handlers that talk to Django must use `apiFetch` from
  `@/lib/api-fetch` (a re-export of `@repo/auth/api-fetch`), which refreshes an
  expired access token and retries once.
- **The admin CMS proxies through `/api/admin/[...path]`.** `lib/admin-api.ts`
  rewrites `/api/x` → `/api/admin/x`; the catch-all forwards to Django via
  `apiFetch` behind a prefix allowlist. Adding a new admin endpoint under a new
  top-level prefix means adding that prefix to `ALLOWED_PREFIXES`.
- **`system_id` is resolved server-side, never sent by the client.** Login, signup,
  password-reset and passkey-authenticate handlers inject it from `getSystemId()`
  (request host → `getSystem()`), so a browser cannot choose its tenant. This is the
  one place website diverges from the other two frontends.
- **`API_URL` is server-only.** It used to be `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, which shipped the
  API host to the browser and baked it in at build time. Every consumer is a server
  component or route handler, so it is now a runtime, server-only variable
  (`passThroughEnv` in `turbo.json`, plain `env` in `helm/values.yaml`).
- Routes that verify auth but call an **external** service (`/api/groq/chat`,
  `/api/ollama/*`) read the cookie themselves and call `refreshAccessToken()` once
  before returning 401.

Passwords: the policy and its live checklist come from `@repo/auth/password-policy`
and `@repo/auth/password-requirements`; the `PasswordPolicy` messages are shared via
`@repo/i18n`. Server-only rules (the common-password list) surface via
`mapPasswordErrors`. Never add `validators=[validate_password]` in `website-api` -
use `run_password_validators`.

## Per-Customer Sites (domain-driven frontend)

This app is **one Next.js app, many customer sites**. Each customer gets a
`sites/<slug>/` folder tied to one customer and one (or more) domain(s),
resolved by request host at runtime (`lib/resolve-site.ts` → `sites/registry.ts`).
`app/[locale]/page.tsx` dispatches the landing page to the resolved site;
`app/[locale]/[...sitePath]/page.tsx` serves a site's optional extra pages.
Unmatched hosts fall back to `sites/_default` (the generic DB-driven template).

**We code the frontend; the customer only self-edits the brand kit + content via
the backend CMS.** To build a customer site, use the **`/new-site`** skill. The
authoritative recipe (site contract, host→site→tenant chain, block library,
registration, styling rules, checklist) is **`sites/CLAUDE.md`**; the strategy
and rationale live in `apps/prds/website-sites.md`.

<Typography variant="none" className="section-subtitle">{subtitle}</Typography>

When adding a new shared utility class to `globals.css`, update this table so the catalogue stays current.

## Shared Constants - Don't Duplicate Across Sibling Files

Before defining a constant, type, or pure utility function in a component file, check whether it already exists in a shared file in the same directory. If the same value appears (or is about to appear) in two or more sibling files, extract it into a dedicated shared module in their common parent directory.

**Current shared files to check first:**

| File                                                 | Contents                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/website/components/admin/paragraph-options.ts` | `PARAGRAPH_WORD_COUNTS`, `PARAGRAPH_LENGTH_STEPS`, `PARAGRAPH_COUNT_STEPS` - used by `admin-form.tsx` and `ai-interviewer/ai-interviewer.tsx` |

**How to apply:**

1. Before writing a new constant in any file under `apps/website/components/admin/`, grep for it across sibling files first.
2. If it already exists in a shared file, import it. If it exists in a sibling but not yet extracted, move it to the appropriate shared file and update both importers.
3. When creating a new shared file, name it after what it contains (`paragraph-options.ts`, `field-utils.ts`, etc.) - not after a consumer (`admin-form-helpers.ts`).
